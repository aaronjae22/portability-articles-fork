# XXX Replace with the title that will appear IN the page (probably longer than the title above)

## XXX What is instruction step 1

Replace everything in this template article with your article text, especially everything starting with "XXX".
The format is flexible so you can have more or less structure than this template. Header lines 
beginning with "##" or "###" are transformed into appropriate HTML tags, and you don't need a specific 
structure to headers.  The YAML header at the top is less flexible.  Take a look at some examples in the
articles directory and you'll see quickly. 

While you're writing explanations, saving explanations by linking to other articles is great.  
If you link to other articles, put the text link in square brackets followed by the link in parenthesis, 
like this [text for link](https://dtinit.org).  

## XXX Another step described

Here's some markdown reminders along with a [link to markdown help](https://www.markdownguide.org/):

 * Separate paragraphs with empty lines
 * Bulleted lists can use '*' with space on either side, like this

## What this solution can do

While we're collecting these articles, it's good to have some editorial about what different solutions
are good for.

## What this solution does not do

As we collect information about limitations, we can also describe what are the pitfalls of different 
portability approaches - this helps people decide before they waste time copying data in a low-fidelity 
way.
