# Exporting your Goodreads book history and importing into Storygraph

## During Account Setup

The most obvious time to do this is during Storygraph account setup.  Storygraph's site will walk 
you through the process of both exporting your Goodreads history, and uploading it into Storygraph.

If you decide not to do this during account creation, it can still be done later.  [This video](
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq4Gvo5O2Cs) has some good instructions on both options.

## What this solution can do

This process does a great job of moving you to The Storygraph.  It takes your entire library.
* If you're comfortable editing CSV files in Excel or a text editor, you may be able to do 
your own filtering.  The CSV format is very straightforward, and a tool like Excel will allow
you to sort by "read date", for example, to import only the latest items from Goodreads.
* It appears that importing handles re-imported lines well, although I did not do extensive
testing.


## What this solution does not do

It's a one-time transfer and there is no ability to catch up.  
* There's no affordance to filter books out of your Goodreads export.  This can matter if your Goodreads history 
is automatically linked to Kindles and accounts are shared with family, for example.
