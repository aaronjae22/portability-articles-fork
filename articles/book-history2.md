# Synching your book reading activity from Goodreads to Shelf

## About the Shelf app

The [Shelf app](https://www.shelf.im/) is part of a mission to help users access and share their own activity data.
After installing, you're prompted to connect to services like Netflix (for watching activity), Goodreads (for
reading activity), Steam (for game play activity), Apple Music and Spotify (for listening activity).  

* Note about 'datatype' - yes Shelf handles several data types but at present the Portability map does not, 
so we filed this article under our one matching datatype, "Book History", for now.

Shelf currently makes this personal media consumption activity available for you to share (importantly, users
have control over what gets shared and especially what gets highlighted).

## What this solution can do

This can help you as a Goodreads user (or Apple Music, or Spotify) share your activity with friends who do 
not necessarily use the same services.  

## What this solution does not do

At present, Shelf does not allow re-export of your data.  It aggregates data from other primary sources, so 
ideally those primary sources themselves would give you access to your data.
