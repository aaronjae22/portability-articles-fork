# Use SongShift iOS app to synchronize playlists between music services

## SongShift

The [Songshift app](https://songshift.com/) for iOS is used by lots of folks to synchronize
playlists between multiple music streaming platforms.  The app supports quite a few streaming services
so check out their site.

## XXX Another step described

Here's some markdown reminders along with a [link to markdown help](https://www.markdownguide.org/):

 * Separate paragraphs with empty lines
 * Bulleted lists can use '*' with space on either side, like this

## What this solution can do

As far as I can tell, this can be used to migrate playlists while changing services, but it can also
be used to maintain playlists across multiple services longterm -- and share those playlists with friends
on the services they use.

## What this solution does not do

Some ways this might not work for you:
* if you don't have an iOS device
* if you are unwilling to share your music account information with SongShift
