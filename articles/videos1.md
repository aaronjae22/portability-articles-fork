# How to export your YouTube Videos to upload somewhere else

Google Takeout offers a way to export Youtube videos in your own account, and they may be portable
to another location.  In order to make use of this, you're going to need to handle the export on a computer
or device that has enough storage to be able to store the ZIP and probably also to unZIP it if you want to
do anything with the videos.

Many other video platforms can accept video uploads in the format provided by YouTube, but you're going to 
have to upload the videos manually yourself. In fact, this export approach [is even recommended](https://it.stonybrook.edu/help/kb/moving-videos-from-one-youtube-account-to-another) 
in order to move videos from one YouTube account to another.

This may be the best option for transfering YouTube videos to the following destinations:
 * [Microsoft Streams](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/microsoft-stream)
 * Another YouTube account
