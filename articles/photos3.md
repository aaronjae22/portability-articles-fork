# How to transfer your Facebook and Instagram Photos to archive and other photo services using DTP

This solution may be for you if you want an easy to use, reliable transfer tool that does not require you to download the files to your local device, saving you bandwidth and local storage requirements. It is powered by the open-source Data Transfer Project technology maintained by the [Data Transfer Initiative](https://dtinit.org/).

Meta offers its DTP-powered tool to transfer a copy of your information via the Meta Accounts Center. You can reach it via [https://facebook.com/tyi](https://facebook.com/tyi) or [https://accountscenter.facebook.com/info_and_permissions/tyi/](https://accountscenter.facebook.com/info_and_permissions/tyi/). Follow the prompts to select the relevant account and information you wish to transfer; select the destination, authenticate to the destination, select the scope of what you wish to transfer, and finally click “Start transfer.” You will need to re-enter your password for the source account to finalize the operation.
 
## What this solution can do

It can transfer a copy of all, or a subset of, your data directly from Meta's servers to a third party service provider, which can either be another service for managing photos and videos, or an archive service.

## What this solution does not do

Because it is designed to transfer photos and videos, it does not include other content from Facebook or Instagram, such as text posts or notes. If you wish to transfer Facebook posts and notes to a service designed to receive and handle such content, see [PUT LINK IN HERE](portmap.dtinit.org). If you wish to download an archive file with all of your content together to your local device, Meta offers a download tool here: [https://accountscenter.facebook.com/info_and_permissions/dyi/](https://accountscenter.facebook.com/info_and_permissions/dyi/).
