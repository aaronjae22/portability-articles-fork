# Plan for Content & Articles

This repository of portability articles needs a little bit of a plan.  Initially, we plan to cover the kinds
of data types and platforms that individual Internet citizens use and host online.  Covering financial,
healthcare and business use cases is a lower priority - see "Not Doing" section at bottom.  We also 
plan to focus on articles that involve some level of moving one's data to another place, not just getting
a copy to stash on a backup disk.  

There are too many variables to make a full matrix of articles we'd like to have (the combination of datatype,
source and destination would make a 3D matrix and it would be rather sparsely filled with actual reasonable
connections).  Instead, this list is organized by data type and exporter or source.  Rather than maintain 
a full list of destinations in this file, please consult the index of published articles. 

To browse what's already published, go to where this content repository is hosted with a query interface
[URL TBD].

## Planned Data Types

### Photos

Datatype: "Photos"

Known hosts for photos, which does NOT include sites that host collections of images that are generally not photos:

* Google Photos - started
* iCloud Photos - started
* Flickr
* 500px.com
* Smugmug

### Images



### Videos

Datatype: "Videos"

* YouTube - started

### Short-form Media

This is intended for short videos, image slideshows, memes, and other media - usually vertically oriented for phones!

* Instagram
* Tiktok

### Text-oriented Social Media

Datatype: "Text Social Media"

Use the string "Text Social Media" for this data type.  Here we mean the ability to port a collection of 
text-based social media _posts_.  For the ability to port a social graph or list of follows, there's a 
different data type

* Mastodon
* X
* Threads

### Forums

TODO

### Follow Lists

Datatype: "Follow Lists"

To port a list of people or accounts to follow to another location

 * Mastodon
 * X

### Email

Datatype: "Email"

Note that these should focus on individual people porting their email content, not on businesses
migrating a number of business email accounts to a new platform!

* Google Mail
* Microsoft Outlook
* Apple Mail.app

### Calendar

Datatype: "Calendar"

* Google
* Apple
* Microsoft

### Contacts

Datatype: "Contacts"

This is distinct from Follow Lists - this is more like address book contents.

* Google Contacts
* Apple Contacts.app and iCloud Contacts - Started
* Microsoft Outlook, Live 365...

### Tasks

Datatype: "Tasks"

* Google
* Remember the Milk

### Music Playlists

Datatype: "Music Playlists"

* YouTube
* Apple Music
* Spotify
* Deezer

### Browsing History

Datatype: "Browsing History"

Usually this is ported between browsers when a new browser is installed on a machine, and it finds
browsing history from a browser previously installed; or when a new computer gets the same browser
installed that the user already synchs to the cloud from another computer.  But there are probably ways
of doing this more intentionally?

* Firefox
* Chrome
* Safari
* Edge
* Arc


## Might do?

Do you know of a way to port data of the following types?  let us know.  Some of these can be exported
but is there anywhere to port them _to_? 

* Shopping history
* Youtube Watch history

## Not Doing

These are the data types we're not planning to focus on for now
* Financial data, even if personal
* Healthcare records, even if personal
* Small business uses cases, including online sales data, ad data
* Enterprise use cases
