# portability-articles
A public-domain collection of articles to help find solutions for data portability

To contribute, update an existing article or create a new one! We can also use Issues to track requests, suggestions
and errors.

To create a new article:
 * Copy all the markdown in the [template file](template.md)
 * Create a new article in the articles directory
 * The article should have a permanent name that can serve as a file name - articles on porting videos can be called
   "videos1.md" "videos2.md" and so on, so if the next available name is "videos3.md" use that.
 * Paste the text from the template file in

You will need to [fork the repository, clone it](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo) an submit a pull request when your change or addition is ready.

After a pull request is merged, the article will shortly appear on a URL TBD.
